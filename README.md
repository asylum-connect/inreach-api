## Development

```
$ cd to catalog-api

$ yarn i

$ yarn run start

In order to run the app you need a [.env][https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv] file with a valid `MONGODB_URI` value for the mongodb connection string.

## Codebase

Our routes documentation can be found at `/docs` on staging and production.

CI/CD
CircleCI is being used to enforce Code quality in all pull requests. Passed status checks are necessary in order to merge a PR.

Code Standards

In order to enforce code standards we use [eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [prettier](https://prettier.io/). Setting up eslint in your code editor is the easiest way to adhere to guidlines while programming but we also lint and prettify code during the commit process using [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged).

Deployment Notes

- Initial deployment requires a "text index required for \$text query"
