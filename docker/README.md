# MongoDB Dockerized

## Purpose

This document will illustrate how to get set up with a dockerized instance of MongoDB to run automation tests against.

## Reason

As more and more developers joined the organization, and automation testing using Cypress was added to 3 main projects, we begun running into issues.

Only one data layer being shared 3 automation suits. With similar naming conventions for the data in all projects, and the practice of self-sufficient tests. All of this has causes tests to begin colliding when running in circleCI.

In order to mitigate this to some level, we have proceeded with creating data layer self-contained tests. By using Docker we are able to instantiate an instance of MongoDB, populate it with some fake data and run tests against it.

## Instructions

### Installing Docker

- Download [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and install it.
- Run Docker and accept Terms and Conditions

### Running Docker

To manually run mongodb in the docker in your terminal(granted you are already at the project directory):

```
cd docker
docker-compose up -d
```

or

```
yarn docker:compose-up
```

You should see the output like this:

```
Alfredos-MBP-2:docker moreira$ docker-compose up -d
[+] Running 1/1
 â ¿ Container mongodb  Started                                               0.9s
Alfredos-MBP-2:docker moreira$
```

To connect to the database using MongoDB Compass use the connection string listed below.

```
mongodb://user:password@127.0.0.1:27017/asylum-connect?authSource=admin&readPreference=primary&appname=MongoDB%20Compass&directConnection=true&ssl=false
```

Add to your local .env file these three new variables:

```
TEST_DB_URI=mongodb://user:password@127.0.0.1:27017/asylum-connect?authSource=admin&readPreference=primary&appname=MongoDB%20Compass&directConnection=true&ssl=false
#Comment ENV variable to connect staging
PROFILE=LOCAL
ENV=TEST
```

To bring the docker image down run:

```
yarn docker:compose-down
```

Note that the DB data will be saved in the path below. Clear that to start the DB from scratch.

```
docker/mongo-volume/
```

### Seeding the Database

In order to seed the database you can run the individual scripts that have the seed: prefix.

Note that organizations related data (ie: comments, reviews etc) need at least one organization seeded, in order to work. Also, I recommend running the addIndexes in order to create compound indexes not defined in the mongoose schema.

You can run:

```
yarn seed-docker-db
```

This will run all the seed prefix, sequentially.

To alter the data being seeded in the DB change the files in the path:

```
docker/seed/generate*.js
docker/seed/addIndexes.js
```
